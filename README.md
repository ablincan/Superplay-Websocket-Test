# Angular + .NET WebSocket Application

This is a full-stack project using an **Angular frontend** and a **.NET backend**, communicating via **WebSockets**. The backend uses **SQLite** as the database, which is automatically created on application startup.

## A quick note before we begin ðŸ˜Š

> I know the original idea was to use a **.NET console application** for the client, and I completely understand that direction.  
> I ended up using **Angular** instead â€” mostly because it made handling WebSocket interactions and building a more visual UI a bit smoother for me in this case.  
>  
> I hope thatâ€™s alright â€” and I hope you don't mind ðŸ«£
